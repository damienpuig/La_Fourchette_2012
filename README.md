La Fourchette 2012
==================

"La Fourchette" is an application that manages the relation between clients, plates and Chefs in a Restaurant environment.
Clients enter in the restaurant, can book plates from the table and can see (status) in real time (Long Polling) the preparation.

The project is composed of 2 majors Layers:

- A Ruby-On-Rails Application: RESTful service from clients, Html-Based client with Long-Polling for Chefs and waiters.
- A Backbone.js Application using REST for Clients.

The Client application, using Backbone.js, is written in CoffeeScript.

The project is fully workable, but has been developed only for SUPINFO University purposes, and didnâ€™t have expectations such as:

- Strong Database Design (Relational + Non-Relational)

- Continuous Integration Plan (Tests and Deployment)
